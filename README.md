# Dead Space 1 - Intro Skip
A simple hack to skip an intro in Dead Space 1.  

Usage: Download project and extract contents of `Release` in game folder.

ds2 version changed for ds1, since it's more universal. Should work for Origin now, as well for any other. 

Altho the code was changed, the previous Release is used with manually patched `IntroSkip.asi` for ds1.
