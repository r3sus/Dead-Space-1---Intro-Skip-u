# Technical details

ds2 version changed for ds1, since it's more universal. Should work for Origin now, as well for any other. 

Altho the code was changed, the previous Release is used with manually patched `IntroSkip.asi` for ds1.

Changed name to `version.dll`, so compaitable with mouse fix by default. For other applicable names see: [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows_library_files#Win32_API), most would work.
